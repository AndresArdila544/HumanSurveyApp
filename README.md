# HumanSurveyApp

A lightweight Flask web application designed to conduct human preference surveys over code refactoring outputs. The app randomly presents participants with 10 pairs of code screenshots — one original and one refactored — and asks which version they prefer based on complexity, readability, and maintainability.
